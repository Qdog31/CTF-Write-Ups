# CTF-Write-Ups Repo

This is where I will be placing all of my write-ups and scripts for the various CTF's I have participated in. Although I do not have a lot of time to create write-ups, this is meant to keep me accountable, help break down conceps learned along the way, and share these cool challenges with anyone interested. Most of my write-ups lack detail, but I plan on improving this. 

**My best write-ups:** 
1. super-helpful (in SecureChampionsCTF(mastercard) repo)
2. Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol (in VariousPicoCTF repo).
