## Challenge

"Ransomware attacks continue to negatively impact businesses around the world. What is the Mitre ATT&CK technique ID for the encryption of data in an environment to disrupt  business operations? 
The flag format will be T####. " 

## Solve

I copy and pasted the question into google and clicked the first link that wasnâ€™t an ad. Although an easy solve, I took time to learn about what T1486 is.
I looked at the link https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/

## Thoughts

I really liked this challenge and althought I got the flag really fast, I was able to learn a little bit about ATT&CK.
